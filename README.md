# Final-Year-Project
# Alzheimer's Disease Detection Using Deep Learning

This project focuses on the early detection and classification of Alzheimer's disease using deep learning techniques applied to brain MRI images. It aims to assist in timely diagnosis and support healthcare professionals in identifying affected patients accurately and efficiently.

## Overview
Alzheimerâ€™s disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects memory and cognitive function. This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze MRI scans and classify whether a brain is healthy or affected by Alzheimer's disease.
